# ECOM BACK END

## Description

This project is a back end for an e-commerce site that uses SQL and Express to configure a database. The reason why SQL and Express are used for an e-commerce site, is that they can provide efficient data management, secure web applications, flexibility in project development, and faster query processing. We were given starter code and we had to configure the database using SQL and Express, although I did not meet all the criteria and my walkthrough and I couldn't properly demonstrate in insomnia, I still give it a go.
